# The Orenthali Mythos and Canon

Distinct from the Aeltharic mythos, the **Orenthali mythos** emphasizes the naturalistic and elemental aspects of existence, focusing on harmony with the worldâ€™s **Four Currents**-*-Sky, Stone, Flame, and Tide. Rooted in oral traditions, cultural memory, and ancestral reverence, the Orenthali canon reflects a pragmatic worldview where divine figures are seen as embodiments of natural forces rather than supreme beings. This approach contrasts with the more theologically driven and hierarchical Aurenthilic cosmology.
