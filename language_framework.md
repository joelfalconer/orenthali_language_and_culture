# Orenthali Language Development

Detailing the structure and elements of the Orenthali language, this document explores phonetics, morphology, syntax, and the writing system created to reflect the balanced and interconnected culture of the Orenthali Confederacy.

## **Philosophical Foundations**

The Orenthali language, rooted in the philosophy of **Kynathar**, reflects the balance and interplay of the Four Currents: Sky (*Kynar*), Stone (*Rynal*), Flame (*Valis*), and Tide (*Thalyn*). This philosophical underpinning emphasizes fluidity, harmony, and interconnectedness. Each word and phrase in Orenthali is imbued with the cyclic relationships of these elemental forces.

1. **Sky (*Kynar*)**: Signifies clarity, foresight, and elevation.
2. **Stone (*Rynal*)**: Represents stability, strength, and resilience.
3. **Flame (*Valis*)**: Embodies transformation, passion, and vitality.
4. **Tide (*Thalyn*)**: Conveys adaptability, flow, and continuity.

## **Phonetics and Phonology**

To reflect the harmonious interplay of the Four Currents, Orenthali employs a soft, flowing phonetic structure, distinct from the angular rhythm of Aeltharic. Over time, linguistic drift has introduced subtle variations, enriching its regional diversity and historical evolution.

- **Consonants**:

  - **Soft**: *m, n, l, r, v, s* (Over time, *v* has shifted to *f* in northern dialects, and *l* often palatalizes before front vowels like *i* in coastal regions.)
  - **Aspirated**: *ph, th, kh*
  - **Voiceless Stops**: *t, k, p*
  - *v* has shifted to *f* in northern dialects, and *l* often palatalizes before *i* in coastal regions.

- **Vowels**:

  - **Front**: *i, e*
  - **Back**: *o, u*
  - **Central**: *a*
  - Frequent **diphthongs**: *ai, au, ei*, though over time, some dialects have simplified these into monophthongs or merged them, such as *ai* evolving into *e* or *ei* into *i* in southern and coastal regions.

- **Phonotactics**:

  - Simple syllable structures, predominantly CVC or CVCC.
  - Avoidance of complex clusters to maintain fluidity. Certain regional varieties, however, permit initial clusters like *thr-* or *spl-* in borrowed terms.

**Examples**:

- *Valis* (flame)
- *Rynar* (stone)
- *Thalua* (flowing tide)

## **Morphology**

The morphology of Orenthali is modular and symbolic, echoing the balanced forces of nature. Over time, linguistic drift has simplified some affixes, such as *-ar* reducing to *-a* in colloquial speech, and introduced irregular forms in frequently used terms like *Valir* becoming *Vail* in certain dialects. It is primarily root-based, with affixation to denote context, tense, and plurality. Drift has also led to compounding simplifications where frequent roots merge phonetically.

- **Roots**:

  - Each root ties to one of the Four Currents, allowing extensive derivation. Over generations, *kyn-* has shortened to *ky-* in rapid speech, and *thal-* has softened to *tha-* in certain regions.

- **Prefixes**:

  - *kyn-*: Elevation or clarity.
  - *va-*: Transformation or intensity.
  - *thal-*: Fluidity or continuity.

- **Suffixes**:

  - *-is*: Plurality.
  - *-or*: Future tense.
  - *-ar*: Agency or actor (evolving into *-a*).

**Examples**:

- *Val* (fire):
  - *Valis* (flames), *Valir* (to ignite), *Valthar* (eternal flame).
- *Thal* (tide):
  - *Thalyn* (tidal), *Thalua* (flowing), *Thalynar* (keeper of the tides).

## **Syntax**

Orenthali prioritizes clarity and balance in its sentence structure, employing a standard **SVO (Subject-Verb-Object)** order with poetic flexibility for emphasis. Regional variations have introduced slight changes in word order for emphasis or stylistic purposes in storytelling.

- **Modifiers**:
  - Adjectives follow nouns (*Rynal thar*: "stone strong").
  - Adverbs precede verbs (*Thar valir*: "strongly burns").

**Sentence Examples**:

- *Kynar thalua valir.* (The sky’s tide burns.)
- *Valir thalua kynar.* (Burns the tide of the sky.)

## **Lexicon Development**

The lexicon draws heavily from natural and cyclical imagery, reflecting Orenthali’s cultural emphasis on balance and harmony. Words often combine roots for layered meanings. Drift has led to the loss of some compounded words, with simpler alternatives becoming standard in everyday speech.

**Examples**:

- *Kynathar* (Sky harmony): Philosophical clarity.
- *Thalynor* (Tidal stone): Resilient adaptability.
- *Valiryn* (Flame’s stone): Transformational endurance.

## **Writing System**

The Orenthali script mirrors the philosophy of Kynathar, with flowing, interconnected glyphs symbolizing the interplay of the Four Currents. Over time, linguistic drift has influenced the script, leading to the development of shorthand forms for common terms and the simplification of intricate glyphs for ease of daily use, while ceremonial texts retain their ornate styles.

- **Style**:

  - Rounded, wave-like glyphs for fluidity.
  - Ligatures for frequently combined roots to enhance harmony. Over time, these ligatures have further simplified into more linear forms in practical writing.

- **Sacred Texts**:

  - Incorporate circular motifs to symbolize cycles.
  - Emphasize symmetry, with elements connected by flowing lines.

## **Sample Invocation in Orenthali**

*“Thalua valis kynar, rynal noris velar.”*  
(The tide burns with fire; the stone stands in balance with the light.)
