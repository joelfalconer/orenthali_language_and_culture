# Orenthali Language Development

Detailing the structure and elements of the Orenthali language, this document explores phonetics, morphology, syntax, and the writing system created to reflect the balanced and interconnected culture of the Orenthali Confederacy.

### **Philosophical Foundations**

The Orenthali language, rooted in the philosophy of *Kynathar*, reflects the balance and interplay of the Four Currents: Sky (*Kynar*), Stone (*Rynal*), Flame (*Valis*), and Tide (*Thalyn*). This philosophical underpinning emphasizes fluidity, harmony, and interconnectedness.

### **Phonetics and Phonology**

Orenthali employs a soft, flowing phonetic structure, distinct from the angular rhythm of Aeltharic. Over time, linguistic drift has introduced variations, enriching its diversity.

### **Morphology**

The modular and symbolic morphology reflects balance. Over generations, some affixes and roots have shifted phonetically.

### **Syntax**

Orenthali uses SVO (Subject-Verb-Object) order but allows poetic flexibility for emphasis.

### **Writing System**

The flowing, interconnected script symbolizes balance and continuity, with shorthand forms evolving over time for practical use.

### Sample Invocation

*"Thalua valis kynar, rynal noris velar."* (The tide burns with fire; the stone stands in balance with the light.)
